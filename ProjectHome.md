# Description #
This module provides an environment validation tool that helps determine whether a server is suitable for hosting the [Alfresco](http://www.alfresco.com/) open source CMS.

The tool is distributed as an archive (zip) file that contains executable scripts that will run the tool.  The tool itself is implemented as a Java (JVM 1.5+) command line application.

Please note that this tool is not exhaustive - it simply validates some of the more common environmental problems Alfresco has seen. Administrators intending to install Alfresco should ensure they have fully validated that their environment is on the [Alfresco Supported Stack](http://www.alfresco.com/services/subscription/supported-platforms/).  They should also ensure they have reviewed, understood and applied the various installation related information available from the [Alfresco Support Portal](http://support.alfresco.com/), the [Alfresco Wiki](http://wiki.alfresco.com) and official product documentation.

After completing environment validation, but prior to installation, administrators should also review the [Alfresco Day Zero Configuration Guide](http://link/to/be/added), to ensure they are able to complete basic configuration of Alfresco immediately following installation.
