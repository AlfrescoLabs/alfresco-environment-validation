Description

  This module provides an environment validation tool that helps determine whether a server is suitable for hosting the {{{http://www.alfresco.com/} Alfresco}} open source CMS.

  The tool is distributed as an archive (zip) file that contains executable scripts that will run the tool. The tool itself is implemented as a Java (JVM 1.5+) command line application.

  Please note that this tool is not exhaustive - it simply validates some of the more common environmental problems Alfresco has seen. Administrators intending to install Alfresco should ensure they have fully validated that their environment is on the {{{http://www.alfresco.com/services/subscription/supported-platforms} Alfresco Supported Stack}}. Â They should also ensure they have reviewed, understood and applied the various installation related information available from the {{{http://support.alfresco.com/} Alfresco Support Portal}, the {{{http://wiki.alfresco.com} Alfresco Wiki}} and official product documentation.

  After completing environment validation, but prior to installation, administrators should also review the {{{http://support.alfresco.com/ics/support/default.asp?deptID=15026} Alfresco Day Zero Configuration Guide}}, to ensure they are able to complete basic configuration of Alfresco immediately following installation.

Pre-requisites

  JVM 1.5+

  You can directly donwload the tool from the Maven artifact repository {{{https://artifacts.alfresco.com/nexus/content/groups/public/org/alfresco/support/${project.artifactId}/${project.version}/${project.artifactId}-${project.version}-dist.zip }here}}.
